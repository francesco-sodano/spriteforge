# Grukk the Goblin Scout — Simple Enemy Example
# A minimal but complete config demonstrating a basic enemy character.

character:
  name: "Grukk"
  class: "Enemy"
  description: |
    Small, hunched goblin scout with bright green skin and large pointed ears.
    Wiry build, roughly 36-40 pixels tall in a 64x64 frame. Oversized head with
    beady red eyes and a wide mouth full of jagged yellow teeth. Wears a ragged
    brown leather vest and torn cloth shorts. Carries a crude rusty short sword
    in the right hand. Bare feet with clawed toes. Long crooked nose. Moves in
    a skulking, low-to-the-ground posture with knees bent. No helmet or shoulder
    armor — just scrappy, expendable foot-soldier gear.
