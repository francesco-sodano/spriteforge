character:
  name: "Kael Stormrider"
  class: "Knight"
  description: |
    Tall, broad-shouldered human knight with a commanding presence. Approximately
    48-52 pixels tall in the 64x64 frame. Fair skin with short-cropped silver-white
    hair swept back from the forehead. Sharp blue eyes, strong jawline, and a small
    scar across the left cheek. Wears segmented blue-steel plate armor with silver
    trim on pauldrons and gauntlets. A deep blue surcoat with a silver lightning bolt
    emblem over the breastplate. Heavy armored boots reaching mid-calf. Wields a
    one-handed longsword with a crossguard shaped like lightning bolts in the right
    hand. Left arm carries no shield — instead the gauntlet crackles with faint
    storm energy. A short half-cape of dark navy cloth hangs from the right shoulder.
